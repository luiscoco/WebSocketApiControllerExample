The server listens for messages from clients and responds to each message with the same message (echo)
The server listens for messages on ws://localhost:5000/api/ws and wss://localhost:5001/api/ws\
The WebSocket instance is wrapped by the WebSocketConnection class that exposes standard WebSocket methods like Receive, Send, Close. 
The class is separately testable and keeps the websocket logic away from Controller.
The solution is fully asynchronous and nonblocking.
Additionally the solution features the AddControllersAsServices approach which means the Controller classes are created in code and not by framework.
